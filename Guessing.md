# Guessing Game Flowchart
## Description
-Below is a flowchart of the guessing game that was created. The flowchart clearly illustrates the steps of the game, the two possible outcomes, and how to win. 

```mermaid
graph TD;
A[Start] --> B[Generate random number 0-20]
    B --> C[Ask player to guess]
    C --> D{Is the guess correct?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Player wins]
    D -->|No| F{Is the guess too high?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Sorry, try again! Hint: Too high!]
    F -->|No| H[Sorry, try again! Hint: Too low!]
    G --> I[Ask for new guess]
    H --> I
    I --> D
    E --> J[End]
```

The game starts with a random number generated for the player to guess. Once the number is generated, the player is asked to make a guess. If the guess is correct, the player wins and that concludes the game. If the playerâ€™s guess is incorrect, they will be be provided with a hint that indicates if their guess was too high or too low. The player will then have a chance to make another guess. The game will continue on like this until the player guesses the correct number and ends the game.
