# About Me
## My Interests
- I love spending time with my family and traveling. In my free time, I enjoy exercising, playing pickle ball, disc golf, and cricket.
## Websites I recommend
	- [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) Ð I find Youtube to be great not just for entertainment, but also for education. It is a great resource that has several videos on any topic that needs further explanation and clarification. 
	- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)- Facebook is not only a social media platform for networking, but also works best for selling and buying items through the marketplace.
